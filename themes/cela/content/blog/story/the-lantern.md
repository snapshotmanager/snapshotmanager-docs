It was the kind of fog that turned traffic lights into watercolor. Driftwood Street hummed with the low murmur of late diners and the hiss of the bay. I had no business being out—my code still waiting in an editor tab—but the note was clear: *If you want to know, follow the lanterns.*

## Crossing the harbor

The first lantern hung from the rusted rail of Pier 7, a dull amber orb swinging like a heartbeat. It lit the silhouette of a fisherman and a stack of crab pots. He nodded once, wordlessly, and pointed to the dark end of the pier.

There, a second lantern waited beside a sealed envelope. Inside: a map drawn in pencil, a line from Driftwood Street to the old lighthouse on the breakwater. Someone had traced it in haste; the graphite had smudged into the fibers.

## What was written

By the time I reached the lighthouse, fog had swallowed the city. The last lantern hung from the door. On the back of the map, scrawled in the same hand:

> *Not every signal is electronic. Sometimes you have to walk out into the mist to see what still glows.*

Inside, the light was out, but the lantern stayed lit. I did what any developer does when something is inexplicably running: I let it run, and I watched.
